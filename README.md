This is the public website for kites.

# how to build it

First install gulp globally (if you have not done so already):
``` bash
npm install gulp -g
```
It's a static site.  You need to run `gulp` to prepare the assets.
``` bash
npm install
gulp
```

Then you can just open `index.html` in your browser
